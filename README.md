# Data_Access
I have created my examples of data access topics in this repository.  I have examples and projects on topics such as entity framework , data first , code first , Orm , database creation.

## ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
Objectâ€“relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible 
type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.

## Entity Framework
Entity framework is an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that offers an automated mechanism to developers for storing and accessing the data in the database. 
This tutorial covers the features of Entity Framework using Code First approach.

## Code First
I migrated the template I created in the application to the database with the Code First approach.


[Go to Example](https://github.com/CeyhunAslan/Data_Access/tree/master/Code_First_Sample_Db).

## Database First
Using the Entity Framework library, we can filter the data by making queries on a table in our database. Almost all the queries you can do
on T-SQL can be done with Entity Framework.

[Go to Example](https://github.com/CeyhunAslan/Data_Access/tree/master/DbFirst_Linq_Example).


## Dapper CRUD

I made CRUD(Create , Read , Update ,Delete) operations to the database with the dapper extension

[Go to Example](https://github.com/CeyhunAslan/Data_Access/tree/master/Dapper_CRUD).

## Library Project
My Library Project, which is suitable for opp approach, with multi-interface repository design pattern,
where the user can do CRUD operations with Entity framework Code first approach.

[Go to Example](https://github.com/CeyhunAslan/Data_Access/tree/master/LibraryProject).
